# Functional Programming

In functional programming we compose our functions to handle all our data,
the goal is have only pure functions, which if we call it in some data we
can produce any program.

Functional programming is more like the math formulas that we have; we can
apply it in any combination of arguments, and it will produce a predictable result.

So, functional programming in it's essence is a way to write programs that are
more predictable and easy to reason about it.
