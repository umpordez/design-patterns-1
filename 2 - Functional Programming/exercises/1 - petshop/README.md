# TODO

Implements the function `scheduleShower()`, the output of this program must
be something like:

```
> Ohh, its friday! :)
        Let's shower Logan!
        Logan, is sooo clean now! ðŸ˜Œ

        Let's shower Blue!
        Blue, is sooo clean now! ðŸ˜Œ

        Let's shower Bartolomeu!
        Bartolomeu, is sooo clean now! ðŸ˜Œ


> Ohh, its tuesday! :)
        Let's shower Pandora!
        Pandora, is sooo clean now! ðŸ˜Œ

        Let's shower Lua!
        Lua, is sooo clean now! ðŸ˜Œ


> Ohh, its thursday! :)
        Let's shower Snoopy!
        Snoopy, is sooo clean now! ðŸ˜Œ
```

the days will be different (since we use a random function to get the days), but
we should print something like that for all six pets
