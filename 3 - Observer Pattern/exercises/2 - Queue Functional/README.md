# TODO

Hey yo, we developed a very nice queue system that can handle rows coming from
an async db!
Very awesome!

But, we have a small issue, we are having hard times to implement the `once()`
function, could you help us? :)

- [ ] Implements `once()` function


The expected output is:

```
$ node queue.js

Processing batch: 0,1,2
Processing batch: 3,4,5
Processing batch: 6,7,8
Processing batch: 9,10

All done, sir.
```
